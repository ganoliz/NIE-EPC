TIP: Write something about the course here and/or copy its description from KOS.

IMPORTANT: This is a starter template that contains only a few basic pages with hints what should be there.
It’s just a recommendation you may or may not follow.
*As a first step, delete all these hints and pages you don’t need!*

TIP: The Course Pages documentation can be found at https://help.fit.cvut.cz/courses/[help.fit.cvut.cz].
The AsciiDoc syntax documentation, the syntax in which these pages are written, can be found at https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[docs.asciidoctor.org].
